### Who you are?
Hi, I'm AmirAli Mollaei, a self-tought programmer and (kind of) AI researcher, with more than 5 years of experience with Python, alongside many diffrent technologies, such as experiments with the multiple libraries such as Deep learning wiht `pytorch` and `tensorflow`, developing graphical applications with `PySide5`, and data visualization and analysis using `pandas`, `matplotlib` and `scikit-learn`, I also tried coding with Rust, Java, and C# and still learning.

## How you got there?
I started learning programming at age 13 using Python, I slowly built my way up to more advanced areas of code, making larger and larger projects, when I felt I was ready, I started learning other programming languages such as C#, Java and Rust, altough I still use Python the most because It's the language that I have most experience in and am the most comfortable with.

### Where youâ€™re looking to go next?
I like to try out new cutting-edge technologies, run my own AI experiments, develop innovative mini-projects and learn new skills in doing so, my goal is to learn new stuff and gain more experience, and make open source sofware as part of my learning.

### Thanks for reading!
