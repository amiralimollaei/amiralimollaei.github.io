# About

Hi, I'm AmirAli Mollaei, a self-taught programmer and (kind of) AI researcher, with more than 6 years of experience with Python, alongside many diffrent technologies.

Over the years, I've experimented with multiple Python libraries and interacted with it's diffrent aspects, including Deep learning with `pytorch` and `tensorflow`, graphical applications with `PySide5`, and data visualization and analysis using `pandas`, `matplotlib` and `scikit-learn`, I've also tried coding with Rust, Java, Visual Basic, C++, and C# and I'm still learning.

## How you got there?

I started learning programming at age 12 using Visual Basic (or at age 11 using Scratch, if you count that as a programming language), One year later I stopped using Visual Basic, and instead learned Python, I slowly built my way up to more advanced areas of code, making larger and larger projects, when I felt I was ready, I started learning other programming languages such as C++, C#, Java and Rust, altough I still use Python the most because It's the language that I am the most comfortable with.

## Where youâ€™re looking to go next?

I like to try out new cutting-edge technologies, run my own AI experiments, develop innovative mini-projects and learn new skills in doing so, my goal is to learn new stuff and gain more experience, while making open source sofware as part of my learning.

## Thanks for reading
